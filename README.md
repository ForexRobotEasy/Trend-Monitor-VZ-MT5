## How It Works

This trading robot is programmed in MQL5 and is designed to work on the MetaTrader 5 platform. Here is an overview of how it works:

1. Include necessary libraries:
   - Trade.mqh: provides trading functions
   - ZigZag.mqh: provides the ZigZag indicator functions

2. Define constants:
   - SYMBOL: the symbol to trade (e.g., EURUSD)
   - LOT_SIZE: the lot size for trading (e.g., 0.1)

3. Initialize global variables:
   - trade: the trade object for executing trades
   - zz: the ZigZag object for calculating wave directions
   - prevWaveDirection: the previous wave direction

4. OnInit() function:
   - Set up the ZigZag indicator by configuring the depth, deviation, and backstep parameters.

5. OnTick() function:
   - Calculate the current wave structure by using the ZigZag indicator to determine the wave direction.
   - Check if the wave direction has changed compared to the previous wave direction.
   - If the wave direction has changed:
     - Update the previous wave direction.
     - Determine the trend direction based on the wave direction.
     - Print the trend direction on the chart.
     - Place a trade based on the trend direction:
       - If the wave direction is downward, sell the specified symbol with the specified lot size.
       - If the wave direction is upward, buy the specified symbol with the specified lot size.

6. OnDeinit() function:
   - Close all open positions before program termination.
